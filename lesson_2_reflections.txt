What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
ans. We create a new empty repository or convert a unversioned project to a Git repository. Then we can save commit we have made in repositories.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
ans. Staging area is in between working directory and the repository. It provides more flexibility to commit changes in git repository and help us to choose more than one files to commit together if we want.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
ans. Branches are helpful in case when we want to try a new change just to test how it looks and works and has nothing to do with debugging. Branches helps in a way that we don't need to think about master branch when we are working on other branches and we can any mix them if we want.
