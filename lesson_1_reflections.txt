was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because if something happens that is creating a bug we can go back and check 
    what mistakes we have done in our new version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually commiting is better because it helps us to commit at right time as
    one can say at each logical change but automatically saved can have problems
    because they might commit too much or too less.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is designed for coding purpose and in coding files are interdependent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first type git log in the repository and look for commit Id you want yo see and
    the use git diff commitID1 commitID2 to check the code change in the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Its feels very good, since one can always go back to previous commit and can
    check in which commit error happened.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want it to use to edit my code.
